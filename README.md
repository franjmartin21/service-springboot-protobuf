# MICROSERVICE WITH GRADLE, SPRING-BOOT AND PROTOCOL BUFFERS

## Quickstart
*Install the compiler of protocol buffers, follow instructions here
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial#compiling-your-protocol-buffers

*Clone the project: git clone ##git-url-project##

*Build the project: ./gradlew build

*Deploy the project: ./gradlew bootRun

## Basic Structure of the project
*service-springboot-protobuf -> Root of the project

*service-springboot-protobuf/build.gradle -> parent build script of gradle

*service-springboot-protobuf/settings.gradle -> settings file of gradle for the project

**Client -> Module of the project that is going to have the code for the client of the service, it will generare a .jar that should be included as dependency of any consumer

**Client /build.gradle -> build gradle script of module Client

**Client /src -> Folder that contains the source code

**Client /src/java -> Contains the java source code

**Client /generated-src -> This folder contains the generated .java generated from the .proto files, this is not version controlled for obvious reasons.

**Client /build -> Contains .class files and is not version controlled, it is generated by the ./gradle build lifecycle

**Service -> Module of the project that is going to have the code for the service itself, it has as a dependency the Client module

**Service /build.bradle -> build gradle script of module Service

**Service /src -> Contains the source code of the service project

**Service /src/main -> java code of the service

**Service /src/test -> unit test suite of the project

**Service /src/integTest -> Integration test for the service



## Package naming convention used

#### Client microservice modules
This is just proposal as I think that we should have a naming convention for this.

*Client classes: com.creditsesame.microservice.##NameMicroservice##.client##Version##

**ie. com.creditsesame.microservice.personalloan.clientV1

*Client proto classes: com.creditsesame.microservice.##NameMicroservice##.protobuf

**ie. com.creditsesame.microservice.personalloan.protobuf

#### Service microservice modules
*Service classes: com.creditsesame.microservice.##NameMicroservice##.##component##

**ie. com.creditsesame.microcervice.personalloan.controller

**ie. com.creditsesame.microcervice.personalloan.dao

**ie. com.creditsesame.microcervice.personalloan.service

**ie. com.creditsesame.microcervice.personalloan.springconf -> configuration of spring

## Why the client should be provided, PROS AND CONS DISCUSSION

PROS:
- Creating the client is a way to ensure the contract

- More testing ensured by the team creating the api

- Backward compatibility better ensured too

- It looks just natural for protocol buffers

- Possibility of adding mock functionality in the client library itself that allows the cosumer to work in a offline mode

- Better understanding on what the API delivers even without reading documentation

- There is some extra work that could seem to be some overhead but actually taking into account that we have the compromise of coming with a good set of tests, the creation of the client should not be seen as extra work in this context but just part of the integration testing suite

- Forcing devs to create clients and run tests through the clients, we enforce them to care about backward compatibitily


CONS:
- Would just be available for a Java consumer, if the languaje chosen is different then the client will need be implemented in their side.

- Exceeding in the abstraction can lead to bad practices in programing of the consumer, as the fact that the client is calling a webservice is not that clear at first glance to the developers

- As the same team creates both the server and client library there is the possibility that some of the logic could leak into the client, which is something to avoid.


## Database connection

This section is not intended to speak about configuration of db connection by environment but about configuration of InMemmory DB for integration testing vs real db for rest of environments:

#### Databases configured:
*MySQL database:




## Environment support


## SQL script management-


## Metrics provided by spring boot


## Evolving API, model proposed


## Unit Tests


## Integration Tests


## Integration Tests and Backward compatibility




## PENDING SUPPORT: Artifact naming convention
